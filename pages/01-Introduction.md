Introduction
============

Hi! I'm excited to be doing business together! If I weren't so adamantly against wasting champagne, I'd say let's smash a bottle to commemorate the maiden voyage of our working together. I'm a good developer; my work is professional, my rates are reasonable, and my demeanor is friendly. I am certain you will be a good client as well.

I can read and write a couple different languages, but legalese is not one of them. I'm sure you are in the same boat. And lawyers are really expensive. So my purpose behind writing this contract is so that you, the client, and I, the developer, can communicate our expectations and requirements in plain language, so that we're crystal clear about who gets and does what when.

It's a bit like the "sign it in blood" sentiment only&mdash;yeah, put the knife down&mdash;ink will do just fine.
