Introduction
============

Hi! I'm excited to be doing business together! If I weren't so adamantly against wasting champagne, I'd say let's smash a bottle to commemorate the maiden voyage of our working together. I'm a good developer; my work is professional, my rates are reasonable, and my demeanor is friendly. I am certain you will be a good client as well.

I can read and write a couple different languages, but legalese is not one of them. I'm sure you are in the same boat. And lawyers are really expensive. So my purpose behind writing this contract is so that you, the client, and I, the developer, can communicate our expectations and requirements in plain language, so that we're crystal clear about who gets and does what when.

It's a bit like the "sign it in blood" sentiment only&mdash;yeah, put the knife down&mdash;ink will do just fine.

About this Contract
-------------------

This contract is here to protect both of us. A couple of things to note:

1. The stages of this contract work like gates; you do not get to move on to
   the next stage until we complete the last. For instance, no discovery or
   research will be done before signing this contract, no development will
   begin until after we agree on a scope, etc.

2. The stages in the contract may seem a bit formalistic at times, but they are
   in place for reasons based on past experiences and common practices. My
   intention is not to be inflexible, but simply to implement milestones and
   expectations that both you and I can count on.

3. I am willing to negotiate several aspects of this contract. This contract
   mostly serves to provide a baseline.
