5. Content and Code Ownership
=============================

5.01 Who owns the code after the project?
-----------------------------------------

With regard to static assets (images, copy, purchased themes, etc), you do. Regarding code and functionality, I do.

Your payment for the work I do is actually to license the code that I write for your use as you see fit.


5.02 Implications for Open Source Contribution
----------------------------------------------

I am very committed to the ideals of the Open Source movement. By working with me, you are already receiving, for no additional charge, the benefits of other developers' open source efforts: software like Drupal and all of its contributed modules, and so on. I believe strongly in giving back to the community, and the way that most developers are able to do that is by abstracting work that clients pay them to do so that the work is useful to other people.

Since I actually own the source code for whatever I build for you, I reserve the right to abstract it out and release it to the community. Don't worry: I won't be giving out any data that is sensitive to your company/business (passwords, payment information, imagery specific to your business, company secrets, etc.). Rather, I'll be taking the functionality of the thing I built for you and, if possible, making it more broad so that it's not so specific to your business model or industry. 

If I am able to and choose to do this, you can count on three things. Firstly, I will notify you that I am doing so; secondly, I will give you attribution in some capacity for having financed the project in part; and thirdly, I will, unless we arrange otherwise, do all abstracting and releasing on my own time. Open source is something I believe in and I do not expect you to foot the bill if that's not your thing.

Most likely, this will not affect you whatsoever. But if you have any questions about open source, your project, or my intentions, feel free to ask.
