6. Misc
=============================

6.01 Arbitration
-----------------------------------------

While I'm certain we will be able to work nicely together, sometimes, it becomes necessary to bring in an unbiased third party.

In the event that becomes necessary, all disputes are to be settled by binding arbitration in the State of Idaho. An award of arbitration may be confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction. (Sorry for that - the language got a little thick there!)

6.02 Severability
----------------------------------------------

In the event a portion of this agreement is deemed to be legally unenforcable for whatever reason, the remaining sections of the Agreement will still remain in effect.

6.03 Entire Agreement
----------------------------------------------

This agreement constitutes the entire and final agreement between us and supersedes any and all prior oral or written agreements or discussions.

This agreement may only be modified with our mutual written approval.
