4. Payment
==========

4.01 Rates
----------

My rate for prebooked maintenance hours is $85/hour.

My rate for all other hours is $100/hour.

4.02 How Payment Works
----------------------

I try to make payments extremely painless. I will invoice you on a schedule that we agree to. These invoices are due within seven calendar days (and this will be reflected on the invoice).

I only accept electronic payments. If other arrangements need to be made to satisfy organizational requirements, we can attempt to make other arrangements before work has started. If alternate arrangements are not made before work starts, this point is non-negotiable.

Upon receipt of payment, I will deliver all work produced during the time period that the invoice covers to the digital location of your choice (email inbox, upload to web server, etc). For maintenance customers, I'm happy to deliver work as it is completed since you've prepaid for your hours.

4.03 Refunds and Payment Edge-Cases
-----------------------------------

Both parties (me, the developer, and you, the client) may, at any point in the term of the project, withdraw our involvement for any reason (unless you are a monthly maintenance customer and your maintenance commitment is not yet complete). This rare event will undoubtedly happen after several conversations and an unwillingness on the part of the client to accommodate the financial consequences of a change in scope.

If this happens, no further hours will be billed and a final invoice will be issued. Upon payment of this final invoice, I will deliver any remaining code, assets, etc. to the digital location of your choice (email inbox, upload to web server, etc).

I will under no circumstances release the source code of my work to you, the client, without receiving some sort of compensation. To me, this just makes sense; you don't get the goods without payment. Neither of us is unreasonable, so, again, be nice to me and I'll do everything I can to make sure you are a happy client.

All work is non-refundable.

4.04 Legal Stuff
----------------

As I mentioned before, I am very serious about payment. It is how I am able to continue doing what I love to do for a living. (Hopefully) without sounding negative, if you, the client, refuse to pay me for whatever reason, I will take legal action to ensure that I am paid. If the case is decided in my favor, you agree to reimburse me for any legal fees I accrue in the process.
